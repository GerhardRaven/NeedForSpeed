NeedForSpeed
============

Fast or not? Collective wisdom on what is faster than other things.

This is a collection of recipes/dirty tricks for how to write C++11
code which will run fast. Some will be examples of how _not_ to do it.
Some will show that it does not matter what you do.

The aim is to provide a library of examples that can be studied.
